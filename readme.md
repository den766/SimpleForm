# Simple Form Project

This is a basic single-page form built with HTML and CSS. It currently has no animations or advanced features, but I plan to improve it in the future.

## Features
- Basic form with input fields
- Simple styling with CSS

## Future Improvements
- Add form validation
- Improve UI/UX with better styling
- Enhance with JavaScript for dynamic behavior

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/den766/SimpleForm.git
